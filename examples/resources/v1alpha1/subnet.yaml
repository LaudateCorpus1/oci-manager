# // Subnet A logical subdivision of a VCN. Each subnet exists in a single Availability Domain and
# // consists of a contiguous range of IP addresses that do not overlap with
# // other subnets in the VCN. Example: 172.16.1.0/24. For more information, see
# // Overview of the Networking Service (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm) and
# // VCNs and Subnets (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see

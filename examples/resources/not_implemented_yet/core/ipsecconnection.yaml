# // IpSecConnection A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple IPSec
# // tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when setting up
# // an IPSec VPN. For more information, see
# // Overview of the Networking Service (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

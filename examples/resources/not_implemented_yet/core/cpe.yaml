# // Cpe An object you create when setting up an IPSec VPN between your on-premises network
# // and VCN. The `Cpe` is a virtual representation of your Customer-Premises Equipment,
# // which is the actual router on-premises at your site at your end of the IPSec VPN connection.
# // For more information,

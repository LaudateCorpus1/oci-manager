# // LocalPeeringGateway A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN peer
# // with another VCN in the same region. *Peering* means that the two VCNs can
# // communicate using private IP addresses, but without the traffic traversing the
# // internet or routing through your on-premises network. For more information,
# // see VCN Peering (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/VCNpeering.htm).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

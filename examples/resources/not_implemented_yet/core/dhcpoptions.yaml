# // DhcpOptions A set of DHCP options. Used by the VCN to automatically provide configuration
# // information to the instances when they boot up. There are two options you can set:
# // - DhcpDnsOption: Lets you specify how DNS (hostname resolution) is
# // handled in the subnets in your VCN.
# // - DhcpSearchDomainOption: Lets you specify
# // a search domain name to use for DNS queries.
# // For more information, see  DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm)
# // and DHCP Options (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingDHCP.htm).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

# // Drg A Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG), which is a virtual router that provides a path for private
# // network traffic between your VCN and your existing network. You use it with other Networking
# // Service components to create an IPSec VPN or a connection that uses
# // Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see
# // Overview of the Networking Service (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

# // CrossConnectGroup For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect group
# // is a link aggregation group (LAG), which can contain one or more
# // CrossConnect. Customers who are colocated with
# // Oracle in a FastConnect location create and use cross-connect groups. For more
# // information, see FastConnect Overview (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).
# // **Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection to Oracle so customers
# // can use FastConnect over the connection, be aware that your connection is modeled the
# // same way as a colocated customer's (with `CrossConnect` and `CrossConnectGroup` objects, and so on).
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
